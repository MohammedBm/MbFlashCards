      },
      {
        question: 'What is State?',
        answer: 'State is the place where the data comes from. We should always try to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components. If we have, for example, ten components that need data from the state, we should create one container component that will keep the state for all of them.'

        question: 'What is a Callback function?',
        answer:

      },
      {
        question: 'What is a Function',
        answer: 'Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What is an Array?',
        answer: 'An array is an ordered collection of data (either primitive or object depending upon the language). Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. This is compared to a variable that can store only one value.'

    title: 'Ruby',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What is a Class?',
        answer:
        'classes hold data have methods that interact with that data, and are used to instantiate objects.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What is an Object?',
        answer:
        'Object is the default root of all Ruby objects. Object inherits from BasicObject which allows creating alternate object hierarchies. Methods on Object are available to all classes unless explicitly overridden.'
